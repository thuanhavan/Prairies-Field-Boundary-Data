**Overview**
This repository documents and links to the Prairies Field Boundary Dataset, a large-scale geospatial dataset of agricultural field boundaries across the Canadian Prairies derived from Sentinel-2 imagery using the Segment Anything Model (SAM v2). The dataset provides polygon representations of cultivated fields suitable for regional to continental-scale agricultural and environmental analyses.
The data support applications in precision agriculture, land-use mapping, crop monitoring, yield modelling, and integration with multi-source geospatial data cubes.

**1. Downloading the Dataset**
The complete dataset can be downloaded from Mendeley Data.
Steps:
+ Open the download URL in a web browser.
+ Select individual files or download the full dataset as a ZIP archive.
+ Extract the files to a local directory.
+ The dataset is provided in standard and cloud-optimized geospatial formats (e.g., Shapefile, GeoParquet).

**2. Visualizing the Data Online**

An interactive Google Earth Engine web application is available for rapid visualization and inspection of the field boundaries.
Viewer: https://cropagronomyusask.users.earthengine.app/view/field-boundaries
Steps:
+ Open the viewer link in a modern web browser.
+ Zoom and pan across Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba.
+ Toggle layers and inspect individual field boundary polygons.
Note: The web application is intended for visualization and quality assessment only and does not replace the downloadable dataset for analysis.
